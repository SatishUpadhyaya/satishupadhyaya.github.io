>_"Entrepreneurs can't forecast accurately, because they are trying something fundamentally new. So they will often be laughably behind plan - and on the brink of success." - Eric Ries_

I'm Satish Upadhyaya and I graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with a B.S. in Computer Science in Summer 2021. I am currently working at Microsoft as a Software Engineer in the Azure Networking org. I'm also a Co-Founder and CTO at a startup currently operating in stealth mode.

During my time at CU Boulder, I worked as a Research Assistant in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/sbs/satish-upadhyaya" target="_blank">SBS group</a>, where I helped develop a <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/sbs/2021/03/11/open-source-releases-our-building-energy-models-commercial-buildings-based-cbecs-data" target="_blank">scalable software system</a> on CUâ€™s supercomputer cluster for running large scale energy simulations. A publication has come out of this lab, regarding the usage of meta-models over running computationally intensive simulations.

In other areas, I interned with Microsoft on the Physical Networking team (remote, Summer 2020). Furthermore, I previously interned at Workday on the Worksheets team (in-person, 2019). In the past, I have also worked as a course assistant for an Introduction to Computer Science course at CU Boulder.

My interests lie at the intersection of software development and entrepreneurship. I love developing products with an immediate, tangible impact in society. I also have love for emerging technologies. My experience spans a plethora of domains within the field. Besides this, I am an avid hiker and skier. My most recent hobby is playing drums.
